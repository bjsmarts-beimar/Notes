How to make REST API in Rails
=============================


1. Create the App 

rails new railsapi

2. In the Gemfile add gem to serialize the resources we are going to expose on the api

gem 'active_model_serializers' 
gem 'responders', '~> 2.0'

3. Also comment the 'jbuilder' and 'turbolinks' gem in the Gemfile, as we are not going
to deal with the frontend part. We will only create the json response which doesn't need these gems. 

4. run => bundle install

5. run the following commands =>

$ mkdir app/controllers/api
$ mkdir app/controllers/api/v1

6. Add the following routes to config/routes.db

namespace :api, defaults: { format: :json } do
    namespace :v1 do
      get     "/contacts/:id", to: "contacts#show"
    end
end  

7. Create the Model

$ rails g model contact

add the following to migration file: 

    t.string   "name"
    t.string   "email"
    t.string   "twitter"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
    t.string   "relationship"

 Run the following commands =>

 rake db:create
 rake db:migrate

 connec to db:

 insert into contacts (name, email, twitter) values ('John Smith', 'john@yahoo.com', 'twitter');


8. Create the Controller for the Model 

$ rails g controller contacts

move the controller to api/v1 folder

edit the controller

class Api::V1::ContactsController < ApplicationController
  respond_to :json

  def show
    respond_with Contact.find(params[:id])
  end
end
